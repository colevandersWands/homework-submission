## Submission Deadline

> Due Friday afternoon

Your homework submissions are due by Friday to give your coaches time to review them before Sunday.  You are expected to complete as many of the exercises as possible and to have made good progress on the project.  It's ok if you don't finish, there are a lot of them and they can get quite tricky. They'll always be there for you to review later :)

Submit your homework even if you haven't finished the project! If you weren't able to finish the project, pleas leave some notes in your homework issue explaining what you struggled, how far you made it, and what you were able to finish.  This will help your coaches know how they can help you individually and collectively when you discuss the project together in class.

What counts as a homework submission?

1. You have created a new issue with a clear and helpful title.
1. The issue has links to your completed weekly project, including a separate link to each branch. (the project must be completed!)
1. You have linked to each of the assigned exercise repositories, even if they are not completed.
1. All of the links must work! One dead link will count as a whole missing assignment.
1. Your card needs to be in the "READY FOR REVIEW", "NEEDS REVISION" column.

If your project is not finished or has some problems, your coach will move your card to "NEEDS REVISION" after checking your work on Friday.  This still counts as an on-time homework submission.

## Weekly Issues

Over the course of the week you will be using GitHub Issues to track progress on your homework, let everyone know what you're strugging with, and to prepare for the next Sunday's review.  

### Homework Issues

For each week you will create a new _homework issue_.  You, your coach and your classmates will use will use it to track your progress, help you when you're stuck, and give feedback when you've finished.  Your class repository has a template issue you can use to help you get the hang of things.

When creating your issue always go through this checklist so your issue is findable and usable:

* __Name__: Name your issue something helpful including: your name, the name of the module, and which week it is for
* __Assign__:  Assign the issue to yourself.
* __Label__: Label your issue with `week-n` _and_ `homework`.
* __Milestone__: Set the current module as a milestone.
* __Project__: Add your issue to this module's homework board.

Besides making it easier to filter and search all of the issues in your class repository, following these steps helps us to easily understand your individual progress through the course (using the GitHub API).  Help us help you!

Once your issue is set-up write the __Check-Boxs__  for this week's assignments including the prep work, project, and exercises.

### Wednesday Check-Ins

> Psst.  Please don't put these on the homework project board!  Reserve the board for homework issues only to avoid cluttering it up.

Each wednesday you are be expected to create a _new_ issue updating your classmates and coaches on your progress since Sunday.  The first step is to set up your issue:

* __Name__: Name your issue something helpful 
* __Label__: Label your issue with `week-n` _and_ `wednesday-check-in`.
* __Milestone__: Set the current module as a milestone.

The next step is to write these four section in your issue's description:

1. __Progress__: What have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
2. __Blocked__: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you strugging to complete?
3. __Next Steps__: What are your goals and your study plans for the rest of the week?
4. __Tip(s) of the week__: Share some tips, tricks or links that made a big difference for you.  

And the last step is to read eachothers' issues. We're all in this together!

### Sunday Review Questions

Your class repository has [a label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/labeling-issues-and-pull-requests) for issues called `ask on Sunday` (it's bright yellow ðŸŒž).  Whenever you come across a problem or topic that you would like to review in class on Sunday go ahead and tag it in your Class Repository!  This could mean creating a new issue there just for your question, or tagging an existing issue in the class repo that caused you and your classmates some confusion.

During the review section of class your coaches will go through all of the labeled issues, closing them when your question has been answered.

## Submission and Feedback Process

We use GitHub [Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues),  [Project Boards](https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-github-project-boards-2944e6ffbf3c) and [Notifications](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications) to submit assignments and give feedback. You will find a [template issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) you can use to start each week's submission.

This homework submission workflow is very similar to a professional collaboration workflow.  You will be able to use GitHub's powerful code review tools to receive & implement feedback, and everything will be centralized in on place: your class repository on GitHub!

The weekly workflow for submission and feedback will look something like this:

1. The week before class:
    1. Create a new issue in your class repo for the coming week (the `weekly-homework` template is helpful)
    1. Study the prep work for the next Sunday
    1. __PREP WORK__: Add your issue to the "PREP WORK" column of the current module's project board _after_ you have familiarized yourself with all of the preparation topics.
1. Attend class on Sunday (on time at 12h!). In class you will prepare for the weekly homework assignments
1. Study away! Move your card to the "IN PROGRESS" column once you have begun working on the week's project.
1. You will keep your coaches and classmates up to date on your progress and your challenges by checking off the boxes in your issue and by moving your card on the project board.
    * __BLOCKED__: If you are very stuck or confused, move your card to the "BLOCKED" column and leave a comment in your issue describing what has you blocked. Include screen shots and [link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet)!  A coach, alumni, or classmate will be around soon to help you figure it out. When you are no longer blocked, please move your card back to ...
    * __IN PROGRESS__: Keep your card here when you are happily working away.  Using the check-boxes in your issue you can keep track of how many assignments you have finished so far.
    * __READY FOR REVIEW__: When you think your homework is finished (the project is complete and you've started all of the exercises). Then move your card into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column _and_ label it `ready-for-review`.
1. A coach or alumni will look over your work
    * __NEEDS REVISION__: If there is anything to improve they will leave their feedback for you directly on GitHub, either in your weekly issue or as new issues in your repository.  You will also know which exercises need revision by which check-boxes are empty. After you have addressed all of the feedback, please move your card back into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column so we know to take another look.
    * __Week X: DONE__: When all of your assignments are checked off and you've addressed all feedback, "DONE"!  There will be a separate column for each week's completed homework assignments. _(Only coaches can move cards into the "DONE" column!)_

## Types of Assignments

While studying with us you will come across 5 different types of assignments. They all serve different purposes, but all will help you succeed at HYF and beyond.

### Prep Work

> You are expected to be familiar with each topic when class starts on Sunday

At the top of each week's README.md you will find a list of videos, articles or examples to study __before__ coming into class on Sunday.  These resources will be _organized by topic_.  You do not need to deeply study each and every link, but we do expect you to familiarize yourself with each topic.  This might mean studying one link from each topic in detail and only skimming the rest.  It's up to you to find the method that works best for you.

### Projects

> You are required to make it as far as possible in the projects

You will be assigned one project each week. The goal of projects is to get "the big picture". Learning how to approach a large challenge, break it down to smaller pieces, and apply the skills you're learning to build incremental solutions. These projects are about more than just writing code that works!  You'll be expected to ...
* Break your project into steps and to develop those steps on separate branches, merging them into `master` when the step is complete.
* A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3).
* Inclide a markdown file called `development-strategy.md` describing the steps you made to complete your project, what value each step adds to the use, and what code you wrote to build each step.
* Deploy your project using GitHub Pages at first, and non-static hosting solutions once you start building full web apps.

Projects come in three types:
1. __Code-Alongs__: For code-along projects you will be assigned a video tutorial to study. You'll need to submit your version of the tutorial's project in a new repository developed with branches, and with a complete README.  Code-along projects are very good for learning new technologies and skills
1. __Starter-Code__: For starter-code projects you'll be given a repository containing a partially complete project and instructions about the steps necessary to complete it.  You'll need to submit your complete project in a new repository, developed with branches, and with a complete README.  Many of these projects will come with built-in tests to guide you on your way.  Starter-code projects will help you learn how to read and understand source code, debug existing projects, and work withing pre-existing constraints.
1. __Open-Ended__: Open-ended projects are what they sound like.  We'll give you a mock-up of a website or a list of user stories and the rest is up to you!  The code-alongs and starter-code projects are designed to guide you to good ways of structuring you code and solving common problems, open-ended projects are your chance to practice these skills "in the wild"!

### Exercises

> You are required to start all exercises

Alongside each week's project there will be a set of exercises.  Unlike projects the exercises will focus in on specific skills, tools or concepts.  Exercises are made up of smaller and more repetitive problems to solve, always with tests so you can move through them with confidence.

Sometimes there will be _a lot_ of exercises, and these exercises can be quite challenging.  You should start each set of exercises to be aware of the skills you're expected to apply in the projects, but you are not expected to complete every exercise the week they are assigned.  If you find you want to dive deeper into one topic, or that you've finished the project early and want to keep studying, go on and finish all the exercises!  Otherwise they'll always be there for you, you can go back and complete the exercises later in the course or after you leave HYF. This has been a successful strategy for many students before you.

Exercises will come in 3 general types as well:
1. __Theory__: Theory exercises will look deeply at the technologies you are using.  All of these exercises will be accompanied by an execution visualization for you to really understand what's happening behind your code. You might find these exercises a bit dry, or might love them!  Either way they're worth every minute you spend studying them.  If you don't take the time to master the theory exercises you will have a hard time debugging your code, applying the technologies correctly, writing & reading tests, or effectively using the developer tools.
1. __Practice__: These exercises are what you probably think of as standard coding exercises, the types of challenges you find on FreeCodeCamp and other web tutorials.  Practice exercises will be bite-sized coding challenges that ask you apply the technologies you studied in Theory exercises to solve small challenges.
1. __Integration__: Integration exercises are effectively tiny projects.  In them you will practice integrating the various skills and technologies you've learned so far into realistic (but tiny) projects.  Imagine something like building 5 websites with only one button each.  It's enough to practice the process of building and completing something without getting lost in the size of your project.

### Assessments

> You are required to attend all assessments

Don't panic.  On a few Sunday mornings throughout your time with us there will be a small assessment.  These aren't like standard tests in school where we're measuring how well you can answer our questions so we can give you a grade.  And you won't get kicked out if you're having an off day.  We also take into consideration all of your projects, homeworks, and active participation.  If you don't do so well on an assessment it's not the end of the world.

Our assessments are what's called [formative assessments](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/what-are-formative-assessments-and-why-should-we-use-them/).  The goal of these assessments is to get an idea of where you each are in your learning.  What have you mastered? What do you still need to work on?  We'll use this information to make sure you each get the help you need, and to adjust the pace of the next module if necessary.

So get a little extra sleep the Saturday before, come in relaxed and rested, we'll hand out the assignment and you'll turn it in before class starts. These assessments will help us to help you, but aren't the only thing that counts.

### Deeper Dives

> Not required, but the fun stuff never is ;)

Each module will have a page called `Deeper Dives` in it's wiki.  In here are a list of tutorials, projects, and extra study materials for you to explore.  Some of the deeper dives will help you prepare for the next module, others will go deeper into concepts covered in the module, and yet others are just fun and cool.  We won't be checking up on these, they're here for your enrichment :mortar_board:.

Enjoy!

## Missing Assignments Policy

1. Missing  _3_  homework submissions is grounds for leaving Hack Your Future.  Should this happen we will have a 1-1 meeting with you to determine the best course of action.   (not turning on GitHub Pages counts as a missed submission!)
1. Submitting  _2_  incomplete homework assignments is a sign that you need more support or accommodation from us.  Should this happen please get in touch with us to schedule a 1-1 meeting with so we can understand your situation and how we can best help you.  
1. Cheating  _1_  time is grounds for leaving Hack Your Future. if we find out you are doing this we will have a 1-1 meeting and it will probably be the end of your time with us.

What does this all mean?  It means:
* Submit your homework even if it isnâ€™t complete.  We canâ€™t help you if we donâ€™t know what youâ€™re struggling with! If you are not able to finish your project on time, please leave your card in the "BLOCKED" column.  Not finishing an assignment because you were truely stuck will never get you in trouble, but saying you are finished when you clearly aren't will count as a missed assignment.  This is how we will know to help you.
* Be accountable and thorough, ask for help often and submit your homework on time.  If you haven't completed the whole assignment you can still submit it correctly.
* There is no penalty for not understanding, only for not trying.  Web development is very challenging, even your coaches spend most of their time learning and fixing mistakes!
* Cheating is not tolerated.  There is a large difference between stealing and collaborating, even if the end result looks the same (ie. you both have the same code).
  * __Collaboration__ is when you ask each other for help or for explanations, you voluntarily share snippets of code, and take the time to explain/understand what has been shared.
  * __Cheating__ is when you copy someoneâ€™s code to complete the homeworks without taking to the time to understand it, and without them explaining why they wrote what they did.
* If we see two or more homework assignments with the same solutions we will check in with everyone involved to see if this was collaborative work or cheating.
